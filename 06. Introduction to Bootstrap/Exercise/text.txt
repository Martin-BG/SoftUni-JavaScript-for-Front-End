Bootstrap
Front-end component library

Introduction to Bootstrap...
Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.

Bootstrap Grid System...
Bootstrap’s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. It’s built with flexbox and is fully responsive. Below is an example and an in-depth look at how the grid comes together.

Themes...
Using the themes is as easy as downloading a CSS file and replacing the one that comes with Bootstrap. You can install as a package via npm with the command npm install bootswatch. You can also hotlink the themes via CDN at BootstrapCDN.
